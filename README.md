# vr_ctrl_panel
Code for my BA thesis (computer science) to generate a control panel in VR that can be used with haptic gloves

## 2020-05-21 
Project running, showing simple wire box
- lots of reading (docs)
- problem using NDAPI with cgv (cannot instantiate)
- implemented simple functions with glove
	- vibrate thumb + index when their contacts touch
	- print index quaternions
- edited vr_ctrl_panel.pj so one only has to personalize and run it to set up the whole project, including NDAPI
- implemented class test.cxx to show simple wire box with wire_box_renderer
